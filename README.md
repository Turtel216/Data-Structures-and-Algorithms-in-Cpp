# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

## About

A project started for educational purposes, containing implementations of DAs in the C++ Programming Language

**NOTE** The source files that end with _visualized.cpp show the algorithm visually and on Unix systems(only) it also makes a beeping sound. To run these files type the command:

        g++ -lSDL2 -std=c++20 algorithm_name_visualized.cpp
